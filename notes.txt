Notes:
- Change DB credentials in DBConnection.java before running.
- For real deployment change demo background timer to run daily (86400000 ms) instead of 60000 ms.
- Create folder resources/barcode before generating QR images.
- To scan barcodes you will need a separate camera integration; this project only shows QR generation.
